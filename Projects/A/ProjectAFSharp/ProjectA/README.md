* To compile and execute immediately, navigate to ProjectA folder and
  C:\FolderPath> compileAndRun[.bat] (Windows)
  $ ./compileAndRun.sh  (Linux/MacOs)

* To just compile, navigate to ProjectA folder and
  C:\FolderPath> compile[.bat] (Windows)
  $ ./compile.sh  (Linux/MacOs)

[.bat] means that this file extension is normally omitted on Windows.
